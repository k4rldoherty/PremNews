## Project Description
For our project we intend to design an application for publishing on the Google Play store that allows users to up-to-date news about Premier League football teams, all in one convienent app.
The app uses a realtime database (Firebase) to store news from multiple sources, which are scraped using Python. The front-end is created using android studio, written in Java.
